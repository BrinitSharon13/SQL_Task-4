# SQL_Task-4
Function have two types:
single row function and multi row function
Multi row function :
* Multi row function is also called as Aggregate function or grouping function
* Multi Row function will take multiple input and there will be only one output
* Aggregate functions in SQL are used to perform calculations on multiple rows of a tableâ€™s column and return a single value.
* Common aggregate functions include SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(), MIN(), and MAX().
* To apply these functions to groups of rows, SQL uses the GROUP BY clause, which groups rows that have the same values in specified columns. The HAVING clause is then used to filter groups based on aggregate results, similar to how WHERE filters individual rows.
